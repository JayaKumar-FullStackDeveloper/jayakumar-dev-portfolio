        Hi! I am Jayakumar, and I am a Full Stack Developer specializing in React.js development. 
        I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer 
        Science Engineering in 2023 from Annai Teresa College of Engineering, where I graduated with a 75% score.
        After graduating, I initially worked in production management at Bright Brothers Private Ltd for a year, 
        where I gained valuable experience in managing MNC Machine operations and handling manpower.</p>
      <p className='text-justify text-sm font-medium leading-5.5 pb-2'>
        However, during my final year in college, I worked on an IBM project called the Plasma Donor Web Application,
         which was focused on developing cloud-based solutions.
        This project sparked my interest in web development. 
        I thoroughly enjoyed the coding, problem-solving, and creativity involved, and 
        that experience made me realize I wanted to pursue a career in this field.</p>
      <p className='text-justify text-sm font-medium leading-5.5 pb-2'>
        To build on that passion, I took on an internship at Why Global Service, where I am currently working on several
         projects with a primary focus on front-end development using React.js. I have been responsible for designing user interfaces, 
         implementing complex features, and optimizing web applications. I am also experienced in state management using 
         React hooks and the Context API, as well as integrating RESTful APIs to enhance functionality.
        In addition to front-end work, I have backend development experience with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, 
        allowing me to contribute as a full-stack developer. I've built REST APIs, managed databases, and 
        ensured seamless communication between the frontend and backend.
        Technically, I'm proficient in Tailwind CSS, HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (ES6+).</p>
      <p className='text-justify text-sm font-medium leading-5.5'>
        I also have experience with tools like Docker, Postman, and Git for containerization,
        API testing, and version control. At Why Global Service, I've worked with cross-functional teams,
        which has further strengthened my problem-solving and collaboration skills.
        I'm a passionate learner and committed to keeping up with the latest trends in web development.
        My IBM project led me to this career path, and I've since been dedicated to advancing my skills in React.js and full-stack development.
        Once again, thank you for this opportunity. I'm excited to discuss how my skills and experiences
        align with the role, and I look forward to contributing to your team.
