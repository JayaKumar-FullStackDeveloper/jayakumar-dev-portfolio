        Hi! I am Jayakumar, and I am a Full Stack Developer specializing in React.js development.
        I thoroughly enjoyed the coding, problem-solving, and creativity involved, and 
        that experience made me realize I wanted to pursue a career in this field.</p>
      <p className='text-justify text-sm font-medium leading-5.5 pb-2'>
        To build on that passion, I took on an internship at Why Global Service, where I am currently working on several
         projects with a primary focus on front-end development using React.js. I have been responsible for designing user interfaces, 
         implementing complex features, and optimizing web applications. I am also experienced in state management using 
         React hooks and the Context API, as well as integrating RESTful APIs to enhance functionality.</p>
      <p className='text-justify text-sm font-medium leading-5.5 pb-2'>
        In addition to front-end work, I have backend development experience with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, 
        allowing me to contribute as a full-stack developer. I've built REST APIs, managed databases, and 
        ensured seamless communication between the frontend and backend.
        Technically, I'm proficient in Tailwind CSS, HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (ES6+).</p>
      <p className='text-justify text-sm font-medium leading-5.5'>
        I also have experience with tools like Docker, Postman, and Git for containerization,
        API testing, and version control. 
        I'm a passionate learner and committed to keeping up with the latest trends in web development.
        I'm excited to discuss how my skills and experiences
        align with the role, and I look forward to contributing to your team.
